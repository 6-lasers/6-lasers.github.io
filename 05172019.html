<h2>Overall Verdict (tl;dr)</h2>

<p><strong>Special Box</strong> is one of the best at this price point. Not as good as the Ultra Box, but much better than the average 480-coin box.</p>

<p><strong>Great Box</strong> is less terrible than normal but still worse than any of the other deals available.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra Box has 20 passes</strong>. If you like passes that's probably all you need to hear, but the "bonus" items are good too--4 Super Incubators and 5 Star Pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Adventure Box</strong>, as usual, has a very consistent deal. The current deal is <strong>roughly tied for best Adventure Box yet</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>See table at the bottom of the post for justifications of item valuation.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>If you <strong>only care about Raid Passes</strong> and don't want Incubators, the best deal is <strong>74.0 coins/pass</strong>, from the Ultra Box.</p>

<p>I'll say it again:    </p>

<h3>74.0 coins/pass</h3>

<hr />

<p>If you <strong>only care about Incubators</strong> and don't want Raid Passes, the best deal is <strong>87.1 coins/Incubator</strong>, from the Adventure Box.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you <strong>want both raid passes and incubators</strong>, the best deal is <strong>60 coins/pass, 70.0 coins/Super Incubator</strong>, from the Ultra Box.</p>

<p>Box is <strong>320 coins gain</strong> in value (40.0% off).</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong>:  <strong>One of the best 480-coin boxes but still worse than the Ultra Box</strong>. This box is almost twice as much savings as the average 480 coin box, with 6 super-premium items instead of the usual 4-5, and 2 extra Star Pieces. Really not bad.</p>

<p>Box is <strong>420 coins gain</strong> in value (35.0% off) if you want Lucky Eggs. If you don't want those, it's still a <strong>270 coins gain</strong> in value (25.7% off).</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: <strong>Nope, you still shouldn't but a Great Box</strong>. 9 super-premium items is on the upper end of Great Boxes, but there are no Star Pieces and all the other Boxes are better deals this time around, so there's no reason to go for this.</p>

</ul>

<p>Box is <strong>1370 coins gain</strong> in value (48.1% off).</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: <strong>If you like raid passes, buy buy buy</strong>. This is tied for the 2nd best deal on raid passes <em>ever</em>, and is the best deal since last summer's Legendary Week. Not only that, you also get 4 Super Incubators and 5 Star Pieces for "free" with your passes. Normally, you'd already be happy just to see 24 super-premium items in a box anyway.</p>

<p>5 Star Pieces isn't that much, but for the last 2-3 months it seems to be the most we get, so you can probably be satisfied with that amount.</p>

<p>Obviously, don't buy this for the Incubators.</p>

<p>Compared to the previous Ultra Box, you can see this one is way more worth it for raiders:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>87.1 coins/incubator.</strong> (Equal to historical low!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Box is <strong>1320 coins gain</strong> in value (47.1% off).</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: <strong>Probably tied for the best Adventure Box yet</strong> (note that 3 out of the 6 Adventure Boxes so far are part of this tie). 17 incubators total is equal to the best deal we had before (Eggstravaganza 2019), although this one has 1 less Super and 1 more regular Incubator. However, you get 1 extra Star Piece with that trade-off. The first Adventure Box had 1 less Incubator and a lower Super Incubator ratio, but had 3 additional Star Pieces. All of these deals are really close.</p>
